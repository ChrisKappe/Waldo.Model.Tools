# Getting Started
This folder contains simple scripts for you to get started with the "ModelToolsAPI".

## Load Objects
The first part of any script is obviously "loading the objects".  You need to read a txt-file, and the tool does the rest.  the script "_LoadObjects.ps1" shows you how.

When loading is done (about 30 seconds), you'll have a variable in memory that holds all details on your solution:
- All elements (variables, ...)
- All references (used by, using, ..)
- Code Tokens
- ... 
All you need to analyze your solution!
